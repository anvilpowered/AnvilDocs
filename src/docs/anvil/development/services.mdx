## Time Format Service

### About

The Time Format service provides an easy way to translate a user input to a usable duration.

**Note: The TimeFormatService will handle timezones as defined in the Anvil config.**

### Usage

The following method will attempt to parse the input as a duration of seconds and return the number of seconds.
```java
Optional<Long> oneDayInSeconds = getSeconds("1d");

public Optional<Long> getSeconds(String input) {
    return timeFormatService.parseSeconds(input);
}
```

The following method will attempt to parse the input as the previous method, however if it cannot parse the input an
 error will be thrown.
```java
public Long getSeconds(String input) {
    return timeFormatService.parseSecondsUnsafe(input);
}
```

The following method will attempt to parse the input and return a duration.
```java
public Optional<Duration> getDuration(String input){
    return timeFormatService.parseDuration(input);
}
```

## User Service

### About
The User service allows developers to translate UUIDs to UserNames or UserNames to UUIDs. The translation occurs by
 querying the CoreMembers collection in the database specified in the Anvil config. On platforms that store this data
 , Anvil will attempt to get the data from the platform, if the data isn't present Anvil will query the database.

### Usage

The following command will attempt to get the UUID of a user by their username.

```java

public class CommonInfoCommand<TString, TCommandSource> {

    @Inject
    protected TextService<TString, TCommandSource> textService;

    public void onCommand(String targetUser, TCommandSource source) {
        Optional<TUser> user = userService.getUser(targetUser);

        if (!user.isPresent()) {
            textService.send(textService.deserialize("Could not find the user " + targetUser), source);
            return;
        }

    }
}
```
