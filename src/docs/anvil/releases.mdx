## Changelog

### 0.3.0
This release has breaking changes. Exercise caution when updating as Anvil v0.2 plugins will not work with Anvil v0.3

**New features**
- RegEdit
  - You can now edit the config with commands! Use /anvil[b|v] regedit start &lt;env&gt;
  - Requires permission anvil.admin.regedit, and access to sensitive settings (such as hostnames, passwords) is disabled by default
- RestrictionService: you can freeze players via the api now. Pick from movement, interaction, inventory, commands and damage (or any combination thereof)
- Added appendPrefix() in TextService that uses the bound PluginInfo
- Added TIME_ZONE to config, used by the TimeFormatService
- Added some useful methods to UserService

**Changes**
- Bumped configurate to v3.7
- Moved from kyori text to adventure for velocity
- TimeFormatService now parses and returns formatted strings with weeks
- Key stuff
  - Keys are now constructed with `Key.builder()` instead of anonymous class through protected constructor.
  - Primarily thanks to type erasure, `Key` no longer extends `TypeToken`
- Flattened some unnecessarily nested packages

**Fixes**
- Tab completion fixes on spigot/bungee
- Fixed some bugs with load order in the BaseRegistry
- Many more that aren't listed here


### 0.2.1
Squashed bugs

- Command suggestions work properly now
- Fixed an NPE
- Small code cleanups

### 0.2
This release has breaking API changes.

New in this version:

- **Important!** Registering a listener to a registry now requires you to add .register(); at the end of the call. Plugins will fail silently if this is not done. This was done to make it simpler to specify the scope and order for a listener.
- Added ordering to registry listeners.
- Added @RegistryScoped annotation.
- Keys now require a namespace to register, this is to make inter-plugin data access easier and pave the way for future placeholder stuff.
- TimeFormatService now uses FormatResult for some return types. Use toString() to capture the current state of the FormatResult as a String.
- Updated MongoDB drivers
- Started using checker framework

Removed in this version:

- Nuked the Plugin interface. This interface added unnecessary weight to the API and wasn't being used anywhere.
- The PermissionService no longer has a generic type. This service only has one boolean method to check a permission for the provided subject. Checking the type of this parameter is now done at runtime.

### 0.1.3
Fixed a critical bug preventing banning and muting with Xodus.

### 0.1.2
Fixed bug in BaseManager causing silent failure during DB access.

### 0.1.1
This release fixes an issue where Anvil would sometimes load after plugins that depend on it.

### 0.1
This is the first release for Anvil. While stable, please note that Anvil is still under heavy development.
